Linux 

In realtime we will be using linux OS only to setup infrastructure required to run our application
- Linux os is not only for administrators, 
	- even developers, testers, will also be working on linux os in real time to monitor our application and application servers.

History of Linux
- UNIX 
- linus, he suggested his changes to unix.
- and finally created his own os
- he used minux os, (Linus + minux = Linux)
- He released the OS source code for all. (open source operating system)

- As it is open source, many companies and people modify according to their needs and requirement and release them into market with different names
- ubuntu os, redhat, cent OS, Fedora, Kali linux, debian, open sesu, etc
- Linux setup
	- Use virtual box (with hypervisor)
	- Use cloud
	- Have parallel OS.

In linux, everything will be represented as file.
we have 3 types of files
- ordinary file(normal file)
- Directory file
- Link file


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LINUX

1) whoami
	- to check username of current user.
2) pwd 
	-> present working directory
3) date
	-> display date
4) cal 
	-> display calender
5) touch
	-> creating new file
	-> $ touch ram.txt

6) ls
	-> list directories or files (to display flies in current workspace)
	-> $ ls

7) mkdir
	-> create new directory
	-> $ mkdir spirituality

8) ls -a
	-> it will display all files including hidden files.

9) code .
	-> It will open code editor

10) cat
	-> it stands for concatenate
	-> to create a file with data
	-> $ cat > radha.txt
		-> write something, and then
		-> "ctrl + D"
	-> $ cat radha.txt
	-> $ cat >> radha.txt
		-> to append to current text
	-> $ cat > radha.txt
		-> it will edit the file.
11) rm
	-> to remove the file
	-> $ rm filename.txt

12) rmdir 
	-> remove empty directory
	-> $ rmdir <directory-name>
	-> to remove non-empty directory
		-> $ rm -r <directory-name>

13) history
	-> It shows what all commands we have excecuted

14) clear
	-> It clears the terminal completely.

 "ctrl + l" -> It will align the present commands.

15) Options of 'ls' command
$ ls (will display files in alphabetical order)
$ ls -a (will show all the files)
$ ls -r (will display files in reverse of alphabetical order)
$ ls -l (It will display long listing of files)
$ ls -t (It will display file with last modified date and time)
$ ls -lr (combination of both the command)
Note: order doesn't matter in combinations of the commands.

in "ls -l"
	-> all files are starting with hyphen(-)
	-> and all directoriies starts with "d"
16) ls <directory-name>
	-> will display all the files inside the directory

17) cd 
	-> change directory
	-> $ cd <directory-name>
$ cd .. (to come out of directory)


18) to see file content with line number
$ cat -n filename.txt

19) to create multiple files with one command
$ touch f1.txt f2.txt

20) Copy data from one file to another
$ cat radha.txt > f1.txt

21) To reverse the content in the file(last line at top)
$ tac radha.txt

22) To reverse the content of each line. 
$ rev radha.txt

23) head
	-> head command will display data from top(default 10 lines)
	-> $ head <filename>
	-> $ head -n 13 <filename> 
		-> it will show data upto 13 lines

24) tail 
	->  same thing from bottom
	-> $ tail -n 13 radha.txt
		-> it will show last 13 lines.
	-> by default it will show, last 10 lines.

25) wc
	-> word count
	-> $ wc radha.txt
	-> 15  21 164 radha.txt
		-> 15 is number of lines
		-> 21 is total number of words
		-> 164 is total number of character

26) copy
$ cp m2.txt m1.txt (copy data in m2 in m1)
(we cannot copy from multiple commands into one)

we can do that using cat
$ cat m2.txt m3.txt >> m1.txt (it will append the data from m2 and m3 file into m1)


27) Rename
$ mv m3.txt m5.txt (it will rename m3.txt as m5.txt)

We can use this command for renaming and moving the files
$ mv f2.txt spirituality/


28) Comparing the files
$ cmp f1.txt f2.txt 
$ diff f1.txt f2.txt (it will display difference)
_______________________________________________________


29) GREP
-> Global regular expression print
-> It will process test line by line and print any line which matches given pattern

$ grep '<word>' <filename>
	- it will search for the line which have "word" in it
$ grep 'rama' ram.txt

Note: GREP is case-sensitive command
	-> 

$ grep -i 'rama' ram.txt
	-> for non case sensitive search

$ grep -R 'Tobago' bhakti/
	- It will search for that word under all the directories.


- to install grep.
$ sudo yum install grep
	- for amazon linux

Options in grep:
-i : ignores case sensitivity
-n: display the matched line and their line number
-l: display only file name that matches with the pattern
-h: display matched lines without file names
-R: display matched lines with file names
-c: This prints only the count of files that matches the given pattern

30) Working with text editors in Linux

= The default editor that comes with unix is called vi.
= vi (Visual editor)
= Using vi editor, we can edit an existing file or create a new file from scratch. We can also use this editor to just read a text file.

= modes of operations in vi editor
1) Command mode
2) Insert mode
3) Escape mode

1) Command mode
= when we enter vi, then by default it is in command mode
= This mode allow us to move through a file and to delete copy or paste a piece of text
= to enter into command mode, from any other mode, it requires pressing the [ESC] key. 

2) Insert mode
- This mode enables you to insert text into the file
- All things you type here are considered as input
- To enter into insert mode from command mode, type "i".
- To come out of insert mode, type 'ESC'

3) Escape mode
- Line mode is invoked by typing a colon[:] in command mode
- The cursor will jump to the last line of the screen and vi will wait for a command
- Thsi mode eenables you to perform tasks such as saving files, executing commands.


To enter into vi mode:
$ vi <filename>
	= It will create new file if it doesn't already exists othewise opens existing file.
$ vi -R <filename>
	= Opens an existing file in readonly mode
$ view <filenames>
	- this also opens in only read only mode



esc +    :q!
	- Quit file without saving changes
esc + 	 :wq
	- write and quit (it saves the context of the file)

Usecase:
1) We will use vi editor to insert data at particular place
2) to edit shell script files.


---------------------------------------------------------------
31) SED command
- searching
- find
- replace
- insertion
- deletion

'krsna' => 'Krishna'

$ sed 's/krsna/Krishna/' <filename>


$ sed 's/krsna/Krishna/3' <filename>
	- this is to replace the 3rd occurance

$ sed 's/krsna/Krishna/g' <filename>
	- replace all the occurances
	- g stands for global

$ sed '5d' <filename>
	- It will delete the fifth line

$ sed '$d' <filename>
	- It will delete the last line


To make changes permanantly we will use '-i' option
$ sed -i 's/krsna/Krishna/' <filename>

32) File Permissions in linux

4 developers

J and A : senior dev
S and An : Jr. dev

To same linux
- config.log
	- seniors
		- edit, view, delete.
	- junior
		- view.

---------------------------------------------------------
 working with file permissions in linux os.
$ ls -l
drwxr-xr-x 1 gajan 197609    0 Apr 24 11:13 bhakti/
-rw-r--r-- 1 gajan 197609   21 Apr 23 11:30 data.log

d: represents, it is a directory.
-: represents it as a file.

Therefore, type of file : the starting letter.

File permissions are divided into 3 segments:
a) user (u) (users permission on the file)
b) group (g) (group permission on the file)
c) others (o) (others permission on the file)


r - read
w - Write
x - execute
- : No permission.



filetype	user	group	others
d		rwx	r-x	rw-

= User can read, write and execute.
= group can read and execute. (group cannot write)
= others can read and write (others cannot execute)

-----------------------------------------------------------
33) chmod (change mode)
- used to changed the permissions of the file

u: user
g: group
o: others

r: read
w: write
x: execute


$ chmod g+w <filename>


34) Symbolic mode for changing file permissions
0,1,2,4

number	permission
0	No permission
1	Execute
2	Write
3	Execute + Write
4	Read
5	Read + execute
6	Write + read
7	do everything


$ chmod 777 radha.txt
	- It means all, user-group-others can do everything
$ chmod 765 radha.txt
	- user: everything (rwx)
	- group: read and write (rw-)
	- others: read and execute (r-x)

-----------------------------------------------------------
35) Working with users, group and others.

- In Linux, the sudo command stands for “SuperUser DO”. It allows specific commands to be executed with root privileges by non-root users without changing their identity or specifying the root password. 


= creating a user:
 	$ sudo adduser <username>

= switching between users
	$ su - <username>

Home
	- /ubuntu
	- /username

- $ id <username>
	- to see the informations of users.
	- it will give userid, groupid, groups,etc.

- $ sudo userdel <username>
	- to delete a user. but directory will still be there.

- $ sudo deluser --remove-home <username>
	- for this login into ubunut and then delete it.
	- it will completely remove it.
---------------------------------------------------
usergroups
defn
-----------------------------------
create a group
You can see the groups you have by opening following files
- $ cat /etc/group

to create a group:
- $ sudo groupadd <groupname>

add user to the group
- $ sudo usermod -aG <groupname> <username>

verify the group using:
- $ id username

Note: wheneveery we create a user, along with that a group is also been created

delete user from a group
- $ sudo gpasswd -d <username> <groupname>

delete a group
- $ sudo groupdel <groupname>
